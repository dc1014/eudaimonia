# Server

Typical SPA is to server FE Framework. Can be isomorphic, or separate. Consider separate.

Use case for labels. Mount plugins relative to labels.

Server methods are also available on anything passed to plugin (first arugment passed to plugin register object, duhhh).

One function can only apply plugins to one connection at a time.

Hooray for async.auto. Hapi uses a lightweight version of Async called items. https://github.com/hapijs/items
